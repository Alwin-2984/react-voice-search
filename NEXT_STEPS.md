## To Publish to NPM

1. Make sure you have an NPM account. Create one at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) if needed.

2. Log in to your NPM account in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

3. Check if the package name is available:

   ```bash
   npm search react-voice-search
   ```

4. If needed, update the package name in package.json to ensure it's unique.

5. Test the package locally:

   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

   Then in a separate project:

   ```bash
   npm link react-voice-search
   ```

6. Once you're satisfied, publish the package:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```
